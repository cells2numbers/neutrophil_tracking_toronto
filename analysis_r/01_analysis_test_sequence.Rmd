```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(migrationminer)
source('windroseplot.r')
```

define grouping variable
```{r}
strata <- 'TrackObjects_Label'
```

load profiles 
```{r}
profiles <- read_csv("../profiles/201903_testsequence/IdentifyPrimaryObjects.csv") %>% 
  mutate(Metadata_timepoint = as.numeric(Metadata_timepoint)) %>%
  group_by(TrackObjects_Label)
```

Create tracking profiles using migrationminer::track
```{r}
tracks <- track(
  profiles, 
  strata = strata,
  t_var = "Metadata_timepoint"
  )  %>% 
  print
```

A quick assessment of the track quality. A VOT >0.9 is a good tracking quality, this tracking result has a VOT = 0.78 that shows that the tracking could be improved. 
```{r}
assess(tracks) %>% print
```

Visualization of the migration pattern using a wind rose style plot. 
```{r}
# we need to rotate all angles 
population <- tracks %>%
  filter(Track_Length > 19) %>%
  mutate(Track_Angle = Track_Angle + pi/2) %>% # rotate all angles by 90 degree or pi/2
  mutate(Track_Angle = ifelse(Track_Angle > pi, Track_Angle - 2*pi, Track_Angle) ) %>%
  mutate(Track_Angle = ifelse(Track_Angle < 0, Track_Angle + 2*pi, Track_Angle) ) 

h1 <- plot.windrose(
  spd = population$Track_Speed, 
  dir = (180 * (population$Track_Angle) / pi), 
  spdmin = 0, spdmax = 4.5, 
  spdres = 0.5, 
  dirres = 30, 
  title_name = "Migration pattern first 50 frames test sequence 1 (toronto) ",
  scale_name = "speed in pixel/frame"
)
